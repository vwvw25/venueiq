## About This MVP

This demo showcases the core concepts of VenueIQ:
	â€¢	Date Optimisation: Identifies venues and dates most likely to achieve high audience turnout.
	â€¢	Audience Clusters: Segments audiences based on behaviour, spending habits, and preferences.
	â€¢	Audience Alignment: Matches shows to the audience segments most likely to convert.

The MVP is powered by mocked data to demonstrate the user experience and platform logic.

## Vision & Next Steps

VenueIQ is designed to evolve into a fully integrated tool for promoters, with upcoming features such as:
	â€¢	Automated Tour Planning: Generating entire optimised tour schedules with travel and rest constraints.
	â€¢	Dynamic Pricing Insights: Forecasting price sensitivity and recommending price points for each audience segment.
	â€¢	Sales Velocity Dashboards: Visualising ticket sales curves and early booking trends.
	â€¢	Platform Integration: Connecting with email, paid social, and ticketing systems to directly target identified audience clusters.
